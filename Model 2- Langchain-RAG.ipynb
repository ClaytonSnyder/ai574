    "# AI-Powered Document Retrieval System\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates an AI-powered document retrieval system using advanced NLP techniques. The system employs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document loading and text splitting\n",
    "2. Sentence transformer-based text embedding\n",
    "3. Chroma vector storage\n",
    "4. Similarity-based retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the SentenceTransformer model \"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\" for creating text embeddings, and leverage the langchain library for document processing and retrieval operations. This notebook walks through the process of loading documents, creating embeddings, storing them in a vector database, and performing semantic searches to retrieve relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key libraries: langchain, sentence_transformers, chromadb\n",
    "\n",
    "This system offers improved semantic understanding and context-aware retrieval compared to traditional keyword-based methods, making it ideal for applications requiring nuanced document search and information extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `TextLoader` (from langchain.document_loaders):\n",
    "   - Used for loading text documents into the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `CharacterTextSplitter` (from langchain.text_splitter):\n",
    "   - Splits loaded documents into smaller chunks for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `OpenAIEmbeddings` (from langchain.embeddings):\n",
    "   - Provides text embedding capabilities using OpenAI's models.\n",
    "   - Note: Requires an OpenAI API key to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `SentenceTransformerEmbeddings` (from langchain.embeddings.sentence_transformer):\n",
    "   - An alternative embedding method using the SentenceTransformer library.\n",
    "   - Doesn't require an API key and can run locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Chroma` (from langchain.vectorstores):\n",
    "   - A vector store for efficiently storing and retrieving embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `RetrievalQA` (from langchain.chains):\n",
    "   - Implements a question-answering chain using retrieved documents."

aliens to see notice 1392 supplemental form w4 instructions for nonresident aliens before completing form w4.\\nthis procedure only applies to nonresident alien employees who have wages subject to

the nonresident alien employee was first paid wages before 2020 and has not submitted a form w4 for 2020 or later add the amount shown in table 1 to their wages for calculating federal income tax withholding.\\ntable 1 payroll period add additional weekly 183.70 biweekly 367.30 semimonthly 397.90 monthly 795.80 quarterly 2387.50 semiannually 4775.00 annually 9550.00 daily or miscellaneous each day of the payroll period 36.70 if the nonresident alien employee has submitted a form w4 for 2020 or later or was first paid wages in 2020 or later add the amount shown in table 2 to their wages for calculating federal income tax withholding.\\nthe amounts from tables 1 and 2 are added to wages solely for calculating income tax withholding on the wages of the nonresident alien employee.\\nthe amounts from the tables shouldnt be included in any box on the employees form w2 and dont increase the income tax liability of the employee.\\nalso the amounts from the tables dont increase the social security tax or medicare tax liability of the employer or the employee or the futa tax liability of the employer.\\nan employer pays wages of 300 for a weekly payroll period to a married nonresident alien employee.\\nthe nonresident alien has a properly completed 2019 form w4 on file with the employer that shows marital status as single with one withholding allowance and indicated status as a nonresident alien on form w4 line 6 see nonresident alien employees form w4 in section 9 of pub.\\nthe employer determines the wages to be used in the withholding tables by adding to the 300 amount of wages paid the amount of 183.70 from table 1 under step 1 483.70 total.\\nthe employer has a manual payroll system and prefers to use the wage bracket method tables to figure withholding.\\nthe employer will use worksheet 3 and the withholding tables in section 3 to determine the income tax withholding for the nonresident alien employee.\\nin this example the employer would withhold 32 in federal income tax from the weekly wages of the nonresident alien employee.\\nthe 183.70 added to wages for calculating income tax withholding isnt reported on form w2 and doesnt increase the income tax liability of the employee.\\nalso the 183.70 added to wages doesnt affect the social security tax or medicare tax liability of the employer or the employee or the futa tax liability of the employer.\\nthis procedure for determining the amount of federal income tax withholding for nonresident alien employees doesnt apply to a supplemental wage payment see section 7 of pub.\\nform w4p

series h or hh bonds.\\nat the time of the trade you had the choice to postpone defer reporting the interest earned on your series e or ee bonds until the series h or hh bonds received in the trade were redeemed or matured.\\nthe amount of income that you chose to postpone reporting was recorded on the face of the series h or hh bonds as deferred interest this amount is also equal to the
